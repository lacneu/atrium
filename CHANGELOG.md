# Changelog

All notable, user-facing changes are recorded here. The format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); versions follow the lockstep repo
version shared by the frontend and bridge images.

## [0.1.2] — Sidebar bound, deployment hardening, automated releases

Reliability and operability release. No breaking changes; no API changes.

- **Sidebar loads reliably on large accounts.** The chat list now reads a bounded
  most-recent window (plus all pinned chats, any age) instead of every chat — fixing
  the "too many system operations" failure observed in production on heavy accounts.
  Archived chats can no longer crowd active chats out of the window.
- **Deployment hardening.** New `deploy/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (the real first-bring-up
  footguns), a `convex-env-push.sh` helper that pushes the Convex *deployment* env,
  an auth-key generation utility (`generate-auth-keys.mjs`), and a clearer Compose
  `.env.example` / bootstrap.
- **Automated, tag-driven releases.** Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag now publishes
  `@lacneu/atrium` to npm (with provenance) + both Docker images, stamps the lockstep
  version across all artifacts, and creates the GitHub Release from this file — see
  `RELEASE.md`. GitHub Actions bumped off the deprecated Node 20 runtime.

## [0.1.1] — npm packaging fix

The `0.1.0` npm publish (a manual bootstrap of a brand-new scope) shipped without
the built `dist/` bundle. This release publishes `@lacneu/atrium` correctly — the
static `dist/` is included — via the automated, OIDC-based pipeline. No
application or Docker image changes: the `ghcr.io/lacneu/atrium` and
`atrium-bridge` images were already correct in `0.1.0`.

## [0.1.0] — Initial public release

First public, self-hostable release of Atrium: a multi-user web chat UI for AI
agent gateways. OpenClaw is the first supported provider (Hermes is next).

- React + Vite frontend (assistant-ui) backed by a self-hosted Convex deployment.
- Node/TypeScript bridge: operator WebSocket to an OpenClaw gateway, version-aware
  frame normalization into a stable streaming contract, validated against OpenClaw
  2026.5.19 / 2026.6.1 / 2026.6.5.
- Google / Microsoft Entra sign-in (`@convex-dev/auth`), email-domain gated;
  first sign-in from an allowed domain becomes admin.
- Multi-user / multi-agent / multi-instance routing.
- Bidirectional file exchange (inbound attachments, outbound generated media via
  Convex storage — no server paths exposed).
- Metadata-only observability: key-authed `/api/v1` + an MCP server (traces, KPIs,
  anomalies, diagnostics), never chat content.
- Full internationalization (French default, English) via Paraglide JS.
- Deployment: Docker Compose and Helm, fully environment-driven (`deploy/`).
